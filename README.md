# YOURLS-REX.RED-AMZ-LOCALIZED  
YOURLS-REX.RED-AMZ-LOCALIZED When adding a shortURL prefix it with &lt;&lt;amz->> to create all amazon geo localized / local links automatically.  

Automatically generates multiple records for each amazon affiliate locale geo area.  
The plugin takes amazon.../link1  
as amz-link1  

then generates  
link1-us  
link1-es  
link1-gb  
...and so on   

Works best together with this plugin https://github.com/tobozo/YOURLS-GeoShortURL  
That plugin redirects the users to each geo locale area - it's the fron-end for this.  

It's useful to have the urls separate so you can see how each locale performs.

Any suggestions are welcomed - send bugs and will try to fix them if they are useful for me. 
Otherwise send pull requests. :)
